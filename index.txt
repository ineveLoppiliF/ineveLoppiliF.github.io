Education

Ph.D. in Information Technology (Politecnico di Milano)
Nov 2019 — Mar 2025
Ph.D. in Information Technology at Politecnico di Milano, focused on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision.
My research involved developing novel methods for online and structure-based anomaly detection, with applications in
cybersecurity and object recognition. I also contributed to teaching, supervised M.Sc. theses, and presented work at
international conferences.

M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering (Politecnico di Milano)
Oct 2016 — Dec 2018
M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, with a focus on AI and Computer Vision. My thesis
proposed a template-based object detection algorithm for non-planar targets, requiring no training. Coursework included
machine learning, deep learning, robotics, and computer vision.

B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering (Politecnico di Milano)
Oct 2013 — Sep 2016
B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, combining core computer science and programming
courses with foundational engineering subjects. This interdisciplinary training provided a broad perspective and
fostered a holistic approach to problem-solving.

Experience

Ph.D. Student in Information Technology (Politecnico di Milano)
Nov 2019 — Mar 2025
During my Ph.D., I explored various machine learning and data mining directions with a focus on anomaly detection.
I developed Online Isolation Forest, a streaming anomaly detection algorithm that models data using dynamically updated
tree-based histograms, published at ICML 2024. I also proposed methods for structure-based anomaly detection,
introducing a preference-based framework and a clustering algorithm capable of recovering multiple parametric models
from noisy data. In collaboration with Cleafy, I worked on open-set malware detection, extending Gradient Boosting with
an open-set recognition technique, now integrated into their production engine. I co-supervised M.Sc. theses on topics
including change detection in data streams and explainable clustering, and provided mentorship on applied problems such
as point cloud analysis, template matching, and malicious session detection. These experiences allowed me to contribute
both novel algorithms and real-world machine learning solutions across academic and industrial settings.

Visiting Ph.D. Student at the Artificial Intelligence Institute (The University of Waikato)
May 2023 — Nov 2023
During my visit to The University of Waikato, I focused on online learning and streaming anomaly detection, resulting in
the design of a tree-based method. This work was subsequently published at ICML 2024 and presented in Vienna, and I also
contributed it to the CapyMOA open-source framework.

Machine Learning Research Fellow (Politecnico di Milano / Cleafy S.p.A. / Gilardoni S.p.A.)
Feb 2019 — Jan 2025
During research fellowships, I collaborated on industrial projects including Malicious Web Session Detection for Cleafy,
where I designed an anomaly detection pipeline and supervised an R&D project on behavioral biometrics. For Gilardoni,
I developed a Computer Vision algorithm for object detection in multispectral X-Ray imaging and supervised a M.Sc.
thesis on dangerous item detection for airport security.

alt = hashing for structure-based anomaly detection
Hashing for Structure-based Anomaly Detection
We focus on the problem of identifying samples in a set that do not conform
to structured patterns represented by low-dimensional manifolds. In this work, we employ Locality
Sensitive Hashing to avoid explicit computation of distances in high dimensions and thus improve
Anomaly Detection efficiency. Specifically, we present an isolation-based anomaly detection technique
designed to work in the Preference Space which achieves state-of-the-art performance at a lower
computational cost.

alt = online isolation forest
Online Isolation Forest
The anomaly detection literature is abundant with offline methods, which
require repeated access to data in memory, and impose impractical as sumptions when applied to a
streaming context. Online Isolation Forest is an anomaly detection algorithm explicitly designed for
streaming conditions, and it seamlessly tracks the data generating process as it evolves over time.
